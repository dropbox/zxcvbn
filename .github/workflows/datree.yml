# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A sample workflow which checks out your code and scans your desired k8s config files for misconfigurations using the Datree CLI.
# The results are then uploaded to GitHub Security Code Scanning.
#
# For more information and configurations options, see https://github.com/datreeio/action-datree/
