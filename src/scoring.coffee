  # takes a sequence of overlapping matches, returns the non-overlapping sequence with
  # minimum guesses. O(nml) dp alg for length-n password with m candidate matches
  # and optimal length-l sequence.
  #
  # the optimal "minimum guesses" sublist is here defined to be the sublist that
  # minimizes:
  #
  #    l! * Product(m.guesses for m in sequence) + D^(l - 1)
  #
  # where l is the length of the sequence.
  #
  # the factorial term is the number of ways to order l patterns.
  #
  # the D^(l-1) term is another length penalty, roughly capturing the idea that an
  # attacker will try lower-length sequences first before trying length-l sequences.
  #
  # for example, consider a sequence that is date-repeat-dictionary.
  #  - an attacker would need to try other date-repeat-dictionary combinations,
  #    hence the product term.
  #  - an attacker would need to try repeat-date-dictionary, dictionary-repeat-date,
  #    ..., hence the factorial term.
  #  - an attacker would also likely try length-1 (dictionary) and length-2 (dictionary-date)
  #    sequences before length-3. assuming at minimum D guesses per pattern type,
  #    D^(l-1) approximates Sum(D^i for i in [1..l-1]
